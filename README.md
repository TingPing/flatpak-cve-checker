# Flatpak CVE Checker

This is a simple tool that parses Flatpaks for CVEs and updates.

## Dependencies

- cve-check-tool
- pygobject
- libflatpak
- appstream-glib
- python-gitlab (optional)

## Usage

Basic usage is simply `./flatpak-cve-check --id org.freedesktop.Platform//1.6`.

What this does is find that Flatpak installed in the system, extracts
package information from its manifest, and tries to match it with CVEs
from the [NIST NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/).

You will need to manually call `cve-check-update` to update the database.
Note that this downloads and stores over 1GB of data.

This alone is actually usually not enough to get great results because
in order to find a match your module names and versions must match
the ones in the database which can be found in the
[CPE Dictionary](https://nvd.nist.gov/Products/CPE). So this uses a custom
property to allow setting this information to ensure accurate results:

```json
{
    "modules": [
        {
            /* This would be a typical human readable module name */
            "name": "faad",
            "sources": [
                {
                    /* Many modules don't have a useful version for us */
                    "type": "git",
                    "url": "..."
                }
            ],
            "x-cpe": {
                /* But this is the CPE product name */
                "product": "freeware_advanced_audio_decoder_2",
                "version": "2.8.8",
                /* We may have used a newer commit that fixed a CVE */
                "patches": ["CVE-2018-9999"],
                /* In case you need to ignore a CVE */
                "ignored": ["CVE-2017-9999"]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

To truely get accurate and reliable results you will need to do this for
every module. This is currently a work in progress for the runtimes.

## Automation

You can also create a configuration file to automatically check multiple packages and
open issues for newly detected CVEs and updates. See `config.json.example` for a pretty
comprehensive example.

You then run `flatpak-cve-check --config config.json`. The options `--no-report` and
`--no-release-check` are also very helpful for debugging your configuration without
spamming issue trackers or the release-monitoring site.

To effectively use the release-monitoring feature your module names must match the names
supported (https://release-monitoring.org/distros).
